Welcome to my CompTIA Security+ Study Notes repository. 📚 These notes were created while I was preparing for the SY0-701 exam, from 2025-02-09 to 2025-03-24. They cover key cybersecurity concepts in an easy to understand format, some of them are:

  Basic IT Concepts: Understand the CIA Triad, DAD, and NIST Framework 🔐.

  Threats & Vulnerabilities: Learn about common attacks like phishing, malware, and denial-of-service 🌐.

  Cryptography: Simplified explanations of encryption, decryption, and digital signatures 🔒.

  IAM (Identity & Access Management): Topics like authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and SSO 🔑.

  Network Security: Key concepts like firewalls, VPNs, and IDS/IPS 🛡️.

  Secure Architecture: How to design systems with load balancing and redundancy ⚖️.
